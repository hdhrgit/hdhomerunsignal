# HDHomeRun Signal Monitor

A modern web application that replaces the discontinued HDHomeRun Signal Android app. This web app provides real-time signal monitoring, channel tuning, and device management for HDHomeRun devices in both the United States and United Kingdom/EU markets.

## Features

- **Multi-Region Support**: Supports both US (ATSC) and UK/EU (DVB-T/T2) broadcast standards with region-specific channel maps
- **Device Discovery**: Automatically finds HDHomeRun devices on your network
- **Real-time Signal Monitoring**: Live updates of signal strength, SNR quality, and symbol quality with dBm/dB estimates
- **Antenna Tuning Mode**: Monitor all tuners simultaneously with real-time graphs for optimal antenna positioning
- **Direct Channel Tuning**: Quickly tune to specific channels with channel up/down controls
- **Multi-tuner Support**: Switch between tuners on devices that support multiple tuners
- **ATSC 3.0 Support**: Displays PLP and L1 information for NextGen TV broadcasts (US)
- **Watch Live TV**: Click to watch any detected program in your local media player (VLC, mpv, etc.) via M3U playlist, with right-click option to copy the stream URL
- **Program Detection**: Automatically shows available programs/PIDs on tuned channels
- **Progressive Web App**: Install on mobile devices for a native app experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, dark theme interface with Material-UI components

The original Android app functionality has been recreated and enhanced with:
- Region selection (US / UK-EU) with appropriate broadcast standards
- Device selection dropdown
- Real-time signal strength, SNR quality, and symbol quality meters with dB conversion
- **Antenna tuning mode** - simultaneous monitoring of all tuners with real-time graphing (new!)
- Direct channel tuning with up/down controls
- Channel map selection (region-specific: US broadcast/cable/HRC/IRC or UK-EU broadcast/cable)
- Data rate monitoring
- Program/PID listing for tuned channels with Watch buttons
- Watch live TV directly from the app using M3U stream URLs
- ATSC 3.0 advanced information display (US)
- Automatic reconnection after network interruptions

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- HDHomeRun device(s) on your network
- Network access for device discovery (requires host networking mode)

### System Requirements

**Prebuilt Docker images are available for:**
- **x86_64** (AMD64) - Traditional desktops and servers
- **ARM64** (aarch64) - Raspberry Pi 4/5, Orange Pi, Banana Pi, and other ARMv8 SBCs

**Recommended hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 or newer, or other ARMv8-based single-board computers. These provide:
- Low power consumption (perfect for 24/7 operation)
- Small form factor (can be placed near your antenna/HDHomeRun)
- More than sufficient processing power for signal monitoring
- Cost-effective dedicated hardware

**Other architectures:** If your CPU architecture is not among the supported ones, you can build the container yourself from source. A minimum of 4GB RAM is required for compilation.

The Docker image will automatically select the correct architecture for your platform.

## Installation & Setup

Pull the pre-built container from GitHub Container Registry
https://github.com/hdhrgit/hdhomerunsignal/pkgs/container/hdhomerunsignal

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hdhrgit/hdhomerunsignal:latest
```

OR

1. **Clone or download this project to your server**

2. **Build and start the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the web interface:**
   - Open your browser to `http://your-server-ip:3000`
   - The app will automatically discover HDHomeRun devices on your network

## Usage

### Normal Mode

1. **Device Selection**: Choose your HDHomeRun device from the dropdown
2. **Tuner Selection**: Select which tuner to monitor/control
3. **Channel Tuning**:
   - Enter a channel number and press the tune button or hit Enter
   - Use the Previous/Next buttons to step through channels
   - The app automatically detects channels tuned by other applications (e.g., tvheadend)
4. **Monitor Signal**: View real-time signal strength (dBm), SNR (dB), and symbol quality
5. **View Programs**: See detected programs/PIDs and ATSC 3.0 technical details when available
6. **Watch Live TV**: Each detected program has a **Watch** button that downloads an M3U playlist file, which opens in your default media player (VLC, mpv, etc.) to stream live TV. Right-click the Watch button to **Copy Stream URL** to your clipboard for use in any application.
7. **Channel Map**: Select the appropriate channel map (US Broadcast is default)

### Antenna Tuning Mode

Perfect for aligning your antenna for optimal signal reception:

1. **Activate**: Click the satellite icon button next to the device selector
2. **View All Tuners**: See real-time signal data from all tuners simultaneously in a grid layout
3. **Monitor Symbol Quality**: Each tuner shows a color-coded badge:
   - **Green** (100%): Perfect signal lock - antenna is properly aligned
   - **Red** (<100%): Signal present but poor - keep adjusting
   - **Gray** (0%): No signal detected
4. **Watch the Graphs**: Side-by-side real-time graphs show:
   - **Signal Strength** (left): Overall signal power over last 60 seconds
   - **SNR Quality** (right): Signal-to-noise ratio over last 60 seconds
5. **Optimize Your Antenna**:
   - Prioritize getting Symbol Quality to 100% (green) on all tuned channels
   - Then maximize SNR quality for better reception in varying conditions
   - Signal strength helps with initial rough positioning
6. **Return to Normal Mode**: Click the satellite icon again

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | Web server port | `3000` |
| `HDHOMERUN_DEVICES` | Comma-separated list of device IPs or hostnames to manually add (supplements auto-discovery) | *(empty)* |
| `HDHOMERUN_DISABLE_DISCOVERY` | Set to `true` to disable auto-discovery (use only manually specified devices) | `false` |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Add a specific device on a different subnet
HDHOMERUN_DEVICES=192.168.2.50

# Add multiple devices
HDHOMERUN_DEVICES=192.168.1.100,hdhomerun.local,10.0.0.25

# Disable auto-discovery and only use specified devices
HDHOMERUN_DISABLE_DISCOVERY=true
HDHOMERUN_DEVICES=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101
```

**Docker Compose example:**
```yaml
services:
  hdhomerun-signal:
    image: ghcr.io/hdhrgit/hdhomerunsignal:latest
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - HDHOMERUN_DEVICES=192.168.2.50,192.168.2.51
      - HDHOMERUN_DISABLE_DISCOVERY=false
```

### Region Selection
Select your region (United States or United Kingdom/EU) to configure the app for your broadcast standard:
- **United States**: ATSC 1.0/3.0 broadcasts, channels 2-36
- **United Kingdom / EU**: DVB-T/T2 broadcasts, channels 5-60

**Important**: You must have a region-appropriate HDHomeRun device:
- US models work with ATSC broadcasts
- EU models (HDHomeRun Connect Duo EU, etc.) work with DVB-T/T2 broadcasts

### Channel Maps

**United States:**
- **US Broadcast**: Standard over-the-air channels
- **US Cable**: Cable TV channels
- **US HRC**: Harmonically Related Carrier cable
- **US IRC**: Incrementally Related Carrier cable

**United Kingdom / EU:**
- **UK/EU Broadcast**: Standard DVB-T/T2 over-the-air channels
- **UK/EU Cable**: Cable TV channels

### Signal Quality Interpretation
- **Signal Strength**: Raw power level (aim for 80%+)
- **SNR Quality**: Signal-to-noise ratio (aim for 80%+)
- **Symbol Quality**: Error correction quality (should be 100% when properly aligned)

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and Socket.io
- **Communication**: REST API + WebSockets for real-time updates
- **HDHomeRun Integration**: Uses `hdhomerun_config` command-line tool

### Docker Configuration

## Development

To run in development mode:

1. **Backend** (in `/backend` directory):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Frontend** (in `/frontend` directory):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### No devices found
- Ensure HDHomeRun devices are on the same network
- Check that host networking mode is enabled in Docker
- Verify `hdhomerun_config discover` works from command line

### Poor signal quality
- Use Signal Strength for rough antenna direction
- Optimize antenna position based on SNR Quality
- Symbol Quality should reach 100% when properly aligned

### Connection issues
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure port 3000 is accessible
- Verify Docker container is running with host networking
